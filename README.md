# üëã Welcome to My GitHub! I'm Hariharan T  

## üåü About Me  

From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I realized technology isn‚Äôt just about machines ‚Äî it‚Äôs about solving problems and building trust in a digital world. That curiosity led me to pursue a **B.Tech in Computer Science**, specializing in **IoT, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain Technology**.  

Along the way, I discovered my passion for **Cybersecurity** ‚Äî protecting systems, investigating incidents, and building resilience against threats. Instead of just reading about attacks, I started simulating them in labs, setting up **Snort IDS/IPS**, building **SIEM dashboards with ELK**, and crafting **forensic tools** that mirror real-world investigations.  

For me, cybersecurity is not only a career path but also a **responsibility** ‚Äî in an era where data is as valuable as gold, ensuring its safety is my mission.  

Currently, I am sharpening my expertise in **SOC operations, threat hunting, and digital forensics**, while preparing for globally recognized certifications like **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** and **CompTIA Security+**.

##  My Cybersecurity Projects  
I believe in **learning by building**. Here are some highlights of my journey so far:  

-  **[Snort IDS/IPS Implementation](https://github.com/00112244/snort_works)**  
  Configured Snort on VM and local machines, created custom detection rules, and monitored alerts.  

-  **[SIEM with ELK Stack](https://github.com/00112244/SIEM-Implementation-with-ELK-Stack)**  
  Built a SIEM lab with ELK to monitor logs, visualize data, and configure alerts for cyber threats.  

-  **[Forensic Toolkit](https://github.com/00112244/Unified-Digital-Forensic-Toolkit)**  
  Developed a toolkit combining five forensic tools (email, image, file, URL, and network analysis).  

-  **[Phishing Email Detection](https://github.com/00112244/phishguard-email-analyzer)**  
  Implemented a phishing detection tool that identifies malicious emails based on suspicious keywords.  

-  **[Windows Log Forwarding with Splunk](https://github.com/00112244/splunk_works)**  
  Configured Splunk Universal Forwarder on a VM to forward and analyze Windows logs.
